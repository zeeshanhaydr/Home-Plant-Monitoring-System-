**Project Overview:**
This project is designed to help you monitor the environmental conditions of your plants, including temperature, humidity, air pressure, and soil moisture levels. Using an M5Stack Core microcontroller and sensors like the ENV sensor and Soil Moisture sensor, the system collects data and sends it to an API for remote monitoring and visualization. This can be used to automate plant care routines or simply keep track of your plants' health.

**Features**
Monitor environmental conditions:
Temperature
Humidity
Air pressure
Measure soil moisture levels.
Send data to an external server or IoT platform using API calls.
Visualize the data remotely through a web dashboard or mobile app.
Set alerts/notifications based on predefined thresholds.

**Hardware Components:**
M5Stack Core (ESP32-based microcontroller)
ENV Sensor (for temperature, humidity, and air pressure)
Soil Moisture Sensor
Jumper Wires for connections
Breadboard (optional for prototyping)

**Software and Libraries:**
M5Stack Blockly: A visual programming interface based on Blockly.
Arduino IDE (for uploading code to M5Stack)
Wi-Fi Library (for M5Stack Wi-Fi connectivity)
HTTP Client Library (for making API calls)

**Programming the M5Stack:**
Connect to Wi-Fi: Use the M5Stack Blockly interface to connect to your Wi-Fi network. You will need to provide your SSID and Wi-Fi password.
Initialize Sensors: Set up blocks in Blockly to initialize the ENV Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor.
Reading Data: Read the data from the ENV Sensor (temperature, humidity, air pressure) and Soil Moisture Sensor (moisture level).
Send Data via API: Format the collected sensor data in JSON and send it to a configured API endpoint using an HTTP POST request.

**API Setup:**

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
**app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/api/sensor_data', methods=['POST'])
def sensor_data():
    data = request.json
    # Process the data (store it in a database or perform other actions)
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)**
